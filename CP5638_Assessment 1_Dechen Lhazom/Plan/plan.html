  <h1>CP1406/CP5638 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dechen Lhazom</p>
  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>The goal of the 100SMILES Dental Care website is to improve patient engagement and increase new patient appointment bookings by atleast 25% 
    within six months of launch, by providing a clear, professional, and user-friendly online presence that highlights the clinic’s services, team, and promotions. 
    The website aims to build trust with potential patients, encourage online contact through accessible booking options, and strengthen community awareness of 
    100SMILES Dental Care as a modern and reliable dental provider in Razole.</p>

  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
  <p> The success of the 100SMILES Dental Care website will be measured through a combination of analytical data and client outcomes over a six-month period. The primary indicator of 
    success will be an increase of at least 25% in appointment enquiries submitted via the online form and through email bookings. Secondary indicators will include a reduction in
     phone-based enquiries, demonstrating that clients find the website intuitive and self-explanatory, and at least 30% of total site visits reaching the Services or Contact 
    pages. Qualitative success will also be evaluated through patient feedback regarding the clarity, ease of navigation, and professionalism of the site. Together, these measures 
    will confirm that the website effectively supports 100SMILES Dental Care’s goal of improving accessibility and encouraging new patient engagement.</p>

  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p> The primary target audience for the 100SMILES Dental Care website is families and working adults within the Razole and surrounding Queensland community who are seeking reliable, 
    friendly, and affordable dental care. This includes parents booking appointments for their children, young professionals looking for cosmetic or orthodontic treatments, and older 
    patients needing regular check-ups or restorative procedures. </p>

  <p>To meet the needs of this audience, the website will be designed with a clean and professional layout and colour palatte, and a simple navigation structure that 
    allows users to quickly locate services, contact information, and promotions. Key information such as opening hours, staff qualifications, and booking options will be displayed prominently 
    on all pages to reduce confusion and encourage quick action. The design will also be responsive, ensuring accessibility for users browsing from smartphones or tablets, which are 
    commonly used by busy families and working individuals.</p>
